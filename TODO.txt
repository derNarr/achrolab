* Add "start measurement..." after clicking the button of the eye one
* devision by zero -- how to handle (catch and set value to None and give
  output to terminal?) [when mean and sd are calculated]
* ColorTable -- getColorByName(self, name)?
* ColorTable -- measureMonitor, measureTubes, findVoltgees as seperate
  functions
* implement iterativeColorTubes as class
* check voltages in iterativeColorTubes, should be always integer (not
        float)!!!
* save all measurements in RData file in ./data/measurements/
* is our code python3 compatible? (should be; test it!)
* with statement for file operations?
* write down wich conventions are used (README.txt)
* checkColorTable -- what should this method return?
    - list with True / False?
    - list with differences from mean
* rename tubes.py to devtubes.py
* rename tubes2.py to tubes.py
* rename monitor2.py to monitor.py
* add method setVoltages in tubes.py (with "s" ;) )
