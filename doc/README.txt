This is the documentation to the python module achrolab (see
https://github.com/derNarr/achrolab). It was generated using Sphinx version
1.1.

This repository contains all reStructuredText files. To build the
documentation cd into documentation-achrolab and run Sphinx:

    cd documentation-achrolab
    make html

or:

    make latex

to get a pdf version.

If you clone achrolabutils (https://github.com/derNarr/achrolabutils) and
documentation-achrolab in the same folder you can run Sphinx and the
auto-documentation will work.

This documentation includes documentation about the modules achrolab,
eyeone, and wasco as well as two tutorials. The first tutorial gives an
overview on how to calibrate an illuminated booth using achrolab and the
second tutorial shows how to use those calibrated colors in experiments.

There are also some conventions. If you are interested in contributing to
our project please read them beforehand.

You have to have Sphinx version > 1.1 to build this documentation since
there are a couple of equations.
