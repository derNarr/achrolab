Python Module *achrolab*
========================

Our research group is interested in the characterization of the perceptual
space of achromatic colors. We wrote a python package called *achrolab* to
control the equipment of our :ref:`color laboratory <colorlab_colorlab>`.
In this color laboratory we present stimuli under completely controlled
illumination conditions. The python package *achrolab* encompasses all
software we wrote to control our :ref:`hardware <colorlab_hardware>` and
the functions and classes we use to :doc:`calibrate our booth <tutorial>`.

You can find all code and some example scripts how we use the software at
`<https://github.com/derNarr/achrolabutils>`_.
